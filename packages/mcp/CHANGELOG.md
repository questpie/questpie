## 3.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#186](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/pull/186) [`d6931de`](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/commit/d6931defd2705525091dd0cace56c516a8f9d5c3) Thanks [@drepkovsky](https://github.com/drepkovsky)! - Fail-closed remote workload authority across sandbox and MCP.
  - **sandbox**: add a generic, consumer-authorized workload admission path with
    signed single-use transport binding, strict resource limits, canonical broker
    routing, safe audit events, and no product-specific principal model. Sandboxed
    guests can list and invoke an explicitly bound subset of application MCP custom
    tools through opaque, revocable, bounded host sessions; guests never receive
    the application, database, authorizer, or native broker token.
  - **mcp**: require explicit catalog entries for every CRUD operation, route,
    resource, and custom tool; derive OAuth scopes from that same catalog and
    re-authorize discovery and invocation through scopes, RBAC, and an opaque
    workload authorizer. Apply shared input/output, depth, node, deadline,
    cancellation, catalog-size, global-concurrency, and per-principal-concurrency
    bounds across HTTP, stdio, resources, and direct workload tool calls while
    keeping public errors disclosure-safe.
  - Retire the unsupported `@questpie/ai` workspace runtime and its
    worker/fleet/Harness/provider application model. Historical npm versions remain
    available, but QUESTPIE does not publish a compatibility stub.
  - Remove ambient stdio system authority and the private executor spike; sandbox
    execution remains available through QUESTPIE's core executor service.

## 3.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/pull/125) [`d719ae2`](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/commit/d719ae2b94f9e5e83c398ca9d78fc49e7d757b92) Thanks [@drepkovsky](https://github.com/drepkovsky)! - Make the AI, MCP, and sandbox packages publishable with release metadata, README documentation, package typecheck fixes, and stable sandbox adapter tests.

- [#125](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/pull/125) [`d719ae2`](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/commit/d719ae2b94f9e5e83c398ca9d78fc49e7d757b92) Thanks [@drepkovsky](https://github.com/drepkovsky)! - Add MCP-over-OAuth 2.1. An external MCP client can now connect to a QUESTPIE app purely via OAuth 2.1 (dynamic client registration → authorize + PKCE → consent → token → `POST /mcp`), authorized as `scopes ∩ RBAC`: out-of-scope tools are not even listed, and the user's `.access()` rules still apply.

  - **First-class request `principal`** (`user | oauth | system`) — an OAuth access token resolves to the underlying user, so existing RBAC keeps working, with consented scopes layered on top.
  - **Declarative granular scope catalog** — `collections:<name>:read|write|delete`, `globals:<name>:read|write`, `routes:<key>:invoke` (+ coarse `collections:*` umbrellas) DERIVED from the app's collections/globals/routes and merged into the provider at auth-instance build; the MCP scope gate derives its required scopes from the same source, so they never drift.
  - **EdDSA token-verify pinning** — access-token verification is pinned to the exact algorithm the provider issues, rejecting algorithm-substitution.
  - **Composable `oauthModule`** — the OAuth provider + OAuth tables are a self-contained module. `starterModule` bundles it (existing apps unchanged), and a custom-auth / headless (hono/elysia) app can add `oauthModule` on top of its own better-auth user model.
  - Root OAuth/MCP discovery endpoints (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`, `/jwks`); the HTTP `/mcp` route requires a verified principal (401 + `WWW-Authenticate`). Uses `@better-auth/oauth-provider` (replaces the deprecated `mcp` / `oidc-provider` plugins).

- [#125](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/pull/125) [`d719ae2`](https://github.com/questpie/questpie/commit/d719ae2b94f9e5e83c398ca9d78fc49e7d757b92) Thanks [@drepkovsky](https://github.com/drepkovsky)! - The MCP HTTP endpoint is now expressed through the codegen route convention instead of a hand-written `module.ts`: one shared `mcpHandler` registered by four single-method route files (`mcp.ts` = POST, `mcp.get.ts`, `mcp.delete.ts`, `mcp.options.ts`) on the same `mcp` path. To support this, the codegen file convention now recognises `.options` and `.head` method suffixes (e.g. `mcp.options.ts` → route key `mcp:OPTIONS`), matching the existing `.get`/`.post`/`.put`/`.patch`/`.delete` handling.
