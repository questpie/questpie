The MCP HTTP endpoint is now expressed through the codegen route convention instead of a hand-written `module.ts`: one shared `mcpHandler` registered by four single-method route files (`mcp.ts` = POST, `mcp.get.ts`, `mcp.delete.ts`, `mcp.options.ts`) on the same `mcp` path. To support this, the codegen file convention now recognises `.options` and `.head` method suffixes (e.g. `mcp.options.ts` → route key `mcp:OPTIONS`), matching the existing `.get`/`.post`/`.put`/`.patch`/`.delete` handling.
