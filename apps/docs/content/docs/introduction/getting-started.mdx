# Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up a new QUESTPIE CMS project.

## Prerequisites

- **Bun**: v1.3.0 or later.
- **Node.js**: >= 23 (required for some ecosystem tools).
- **PostgreSQL**: A running Postgres instance with v18 or later (we are utilizing new `uuidv7()` for ids)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if contributing) or use the starter template.
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Running the Development Server

Start the entire monorepo (CMS API, Admin UI, Docs) in development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

To run a specific app, use the filter flag:

```bash
# Run only the Admin UI
bun run dev --filter=@questpie/admin
```

## Configuration

The core configuration lives in your CMS entry point (e.g., `src/cms.ts`). This is where you define:

- Database connection (`db`)
- Collections & Globals (`collections`)
- Authentication (`auth`)
- Queue settings (`queue`)

See the [CMS Configuration](/docs/reference/cms-config) reference for details.
