# Drizzle ORM Integration

QUESTPIE CMS relies heavily on Drizzle ORM.

## Schema Generation

The CMS automatically compiles your `defineCollection` definitions into a Drizzle schema. You do not need to manually define Drizzle tables unless you are doing advanced custom integration.

## Query Builder

The CMS API (`cms.api.collections...`) exposes methods that wrap Drizzle queries, but you can also access the raw DB instance if needed:

```typescript
cms.db.select().from(...)
```

However, it is recommended to use the CMS API methods (`find`, `create`, etc.) to ensure hooks and relation logic are executed.
