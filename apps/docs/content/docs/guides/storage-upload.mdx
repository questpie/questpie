# Storage & Uploads

QUESTPIE CMS uses **Flydrive** to manage file uploads, supporting multiple drivers (Local, S3, etc.).

## Configuration

Configure the `storage` object in your `QCMS` config.

```typescript
import { QCMS } from "@questpie/cms/server";
// Import drivers from flydrive (conceptual)
// import { fsDriver } from "flydrive/drivers/fs";

export const cms = new QCMS({
  // ...
  storage: {
    // default: fsDriver({ location: './uploads' })
    // See Flydrive documentation for S3 and other providers
  },
});
```

## Handling Uploads

When creating or updating a record with a file field (often represented as a `varchar` storing the path/URL), the Admin UI or your custom API handles the file upload separately (typically to an upload endpoint) and then stores the reference in the collection.

*(Note: Full integrated media library documentation is forthcoming).*
